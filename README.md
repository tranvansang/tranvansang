### Hi there ðŸ‘‹. Thanks for having a look at my profile.

#### Here are some of my public projects that might interest you.

- https://github.com/react-loadable/revised

@react-loadable/revised is an npm package that helps you split your client-side's javascript into multiple chunks and load these chunks only when needed.
It currently supports webpack and react.

- https://github.com/tranvansang/middleware-async

Wrap you async expressjs's middlewares. Note that errors will not be caught if you use async middlewares directly.
Besides, this project includes a convenient method `combineMiddlewares`, that can combine (one or) many middlewares into one.

- https://github.com/tranvansang/express-authenticators

Nearly zero-dependence, modern OAuth implementation. The only two dependencies are `node-fetch` and `r3986`. (`r3986` is maintained by me at https://github.com/tranvansang/rfc3986, though).

In spite of the name `express-authenticators`, the project does not depend on expressjs, it can be used in any framework.

Currently, support authenticating and profile fetching for Facebook, Foursquare, Github, Google, Line, Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Tumblr, Twitter, Zalo. You can extend the base class to support any OAuth provider.

- https://github.com/tranvansang/s3-key

A utility to work with AWS s3 key: sanitize a key, encode/decode keys to/from URL.

- https://github.com/tranvansang/enum-for

List all values/keys of a Typescript enum.

- https://github.com/tranvansang/add-evt-listener

You get frustrated of calling `target.removeEventListener(callback)` every time. Also, the callback must always be stored in a variable.
`add-evt-listener` is here to help. It wraps the call `target.addEventListener()` to return a callback which trigger `target.removeEventListener()`.

I make use of this utility very much in many production-level projects.

- https://github.com/tranvansang/tw-elevation

Natural shadow combining three element shadows: umbra, penumbra, and ambient. This is used as a tailwind plugin.

- https://github.com/tranvansang/jcls

Another handy yet straightforward utility to join your css class names.

- https://github.com/tranvansang/rrjx

Python `range`-equivalent in javascript. This utility helps you write for-loop more elegantly. Check the examples at the end of the project's README.md.

- https://github.com/tranvansang/enhanced-reducer

Enhanced React's `useReducer` which supports middlewares and a static (never change) `getState` callback. You can check [my blog here](https://transang.me/get-state-callback-with-usereducer-in-react/) for more information.
In fact, I am not using this project now because it never happens that I do need this functionality.

- https://github.com/tranvansang/img-size-loader

A webpack loader to return the natural size of the loaded image.

- https://github.com/tranvansang/flip-promise

It is inferred from its name. This turns resolved promise into a rejected one, and vice versa.

- https://github.com/tranvansang/jp-postal

The most accurate Japanese postal code database. The project contains the script to pull, parse, and integrate the latest data from the official source.

- https://github.com/tranvansang/jdefer

Defer your javascript promises.

- https://github.com/tranvansang/vim-close-pair

A Vim plugin. Type `Ctrl-l` in insert mode to automatically fill the pending open brace with a close brace.
